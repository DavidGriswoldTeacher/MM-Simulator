# M&M simulator

This very simple simulator allows you to simulate a sample of M&Ms and see their colors. It does not do anything fancy like build graphs - its designed to be used in conjunction with lessons where you're building them by hand, as a substitute for real candies. Made during the COVID-19 pandemic for distance learning. It uses the official published proportions by Mars (which might not be right!)
